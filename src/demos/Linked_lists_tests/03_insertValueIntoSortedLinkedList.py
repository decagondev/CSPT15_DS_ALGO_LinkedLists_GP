"""
Note: Your solution should have O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of elements in l, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

You have a singly linked list l, which is sorted in strictly increasing order, and an integer value. Add value to the list l, preserving its original sorting.

Note: in examples below and tests preview linked lists are presented as arrays just for simplicity of visualization: in real data you will be given a head node l of the linked list

Example

For l = [1, 3, 4, 6] and value = 5, the output should be
insertValueIntoSortedLinkedList(l, value) = [1, 3, 4, 5, 6];
For l = [1, 3, 4, 6] and value = 10, the output should be
insertValueIntoSortedLinkedList(l, value) = [1, 3, 4, 6, 10];
For l = [1, 3, 4, 6] and value = 0, the output should be
insertValueIntoSortedLinkedList(l, value) = [0, 1, 3, 4, 6].
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[input] linkedlist.integer l

A singly linked list of integers sorted in strictly increasing order. Thus, all integers in the list are pairwise distinct.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ list size ≤ 104,
-109 ≤ element value ≤ 109.

[input] integer value

A single integer value to be inserted into l. It is guaranteed that there is not an element equal to value in l before the insertion is performed.

Guaranteed constraints:
-109 ≤ value ≤ 109.

[output] linkedlist.integer

Return l after inserting value into it, with the original sorting preserved.
